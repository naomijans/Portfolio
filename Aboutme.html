      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class= "column" style="background-color:#affdf7;">
      <p> I am eleven years old and am in the sixth grade. I went to Carlton Avenue for grades 1st-5th, and now I go to Union middle school. During the school day, I spend time with my friends. A few of my friends that I spend most of my time with at school are; Sofia, Amit, Sophia, Abby, Marva, Kaitlyn. Friends I spend time with after school, include; Rebecca, Natalie, Manon, Carol, Gwen, Bianca, and Yuna.</p>
      <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
      <p> A few of my hobbies are painting, dancing, and playing the flute. Other things that I do in my free time, includes piano, reading, and Volleyball.
      <h4>Furry Friends</h4>
      <p>I have always wanted a puupy, but have never been able to get one, due to my family always traveling. I have always wanted to have have a white dog, just like one of my closer friends, but haven't been able to yet. After I knew I wasn't able to get a dog, I loathed for a bunny. I have always wanted pets, since I am a only child.</p>
